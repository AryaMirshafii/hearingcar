# Hearing Car IOS

As a part of the Georgia Tech Engineering For Social Innovation group, my team and I sought to create a device for the hearing impaired. Driving requires us to use all of our senses, not just our vision, and because of this, those with hearing disabilities are unable to experience the enjoyment and convenience of driving as safely as others. Our system seeks to display visually the vital aural information from the surroundings so those with hearing disabilities can drive safer than before. For this project, we partnered with the Idaho School for the Deaf and Blind.

## Our Partner

The Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind fosters a continuum of services for people of all ages with hearing or vision loss, including those with other disabilities including deafness and blindness, in the State of Idaho. The Idaho School for the Deaf and the Blind is the center of educational expertise for these children, their families, and local education providers.


### Prerequisites

Our mobile Application is written for the Android operating system using Java. Upon starting the app, the user is prompted to accept a warning about the dangers of distracted driving. Upon accepting, the user is then taken to the main screen . This screen provides him or her a plethora of information. The circular battery indicator shows the user how much battery power remains in the HearingCar device as both a percent and a visual fraction. The main screen also displays the number of left, right, and total warnings so that the user can gauge and adapt his or her driving. Upon receiving a number ranging from 0 to 4 from the circuit, the app will display a the corresponding warning screen for six seconds. In typical usage, the user's phone would be mounted to his or her car's dashboard in order to ensure maximum visibility.
